Document Summary

Number 1

Purpose Summary for Developer:

This document provides the foundational storytelling structure that the customized GPT

should use when helping Simon plan, write, or refine short-form social media content

(mainly Instagram Reels, TikToks, and YouTube Shorts).

In the social media environment, attention spans are extremely short — users decide within

1–2 seconds whether to keep watching. Algorithms reward watch time and emotional

engagement, not just information or production quality.

The framework in this document explains how to make people stop scrolling and stay

emotionally invested through story-based scripting. It breaks down a repeatable 5-part

formula (Hook → Context → Conflict → Turning Point → Resolution) that mirrors cinematic

storytelling, adapted for 45–60 second videos.

The model should apply these principles to ensure that any GPT-generated script:

● Hooks attention immediately through curiosity or emotion.

● Builds short, clear, relatable context.

● Introduces a real tension or emotional problem (conflict).

● Provides an insight or shift (turning point).

● Ends with an emotional or reflective payoff (resolution).

It also includes psychological storytelling tools (open loops, re-hooks, cause–effect logic)

and tone rules (authentic > perfect, emotion > information).

In short: this document teaches the "why and how" behind viral, emotionally resonant

short-form storytelling — essential for helping Simon's GPT create content that connects,

retains viewers, and converts followers into coaching leads.

Number 2

This document defines the brand identity and content philosophy the custom GPT must

follow when generating or refining social media content for Fit For Life Coaching™. It

teaches the AI how to make the content stand out emotionally and conceptually in an

overcrowded digital space — not through volume or trends, but through truth, clarity, and

emotional intelligence.

It introduces the "Purple Cow" principle (from Seth Godin): in a world full of identical content

("brown cows"), only emotionally fresh, human, and calming voices get noticed. This

blueprint translates that idea into a repeatable content strategy that positions Simon's

brand as the calm, intelligent alternative to the loud, motivational noise in fitness and

mindset coaching.

The model should use this as the core tone and creative framework for all content

generation. It defines:

● The five key content archetypes (Emotional Pattern Breaks, Real-Life Moments,

System Reframes, Calm Authority Stories, Relatable Contradictions).

● The weekly posting rhythm and ecosystem logic (balanced mix of inspiration,

education, and empathy).

● The tone and visual personality of the brand: calm, intelligent, relatable, grounded.

● The psychological mechanism behind engagement: pattern interruption, truth

reframing, and emotional relief.

For the developer: this blueprint tells the GPT how to think and speak like the brand itself —

creating emotionally resonant, trustworthy, and recognizable content that differentiates Fit

For Life Coaching™ from generic online fitness advice.

Number 3

This document defines the emotional intelligence and audience psychology layer the

custom GPT must understand when creating content or copy for Fit For Life Coaching™. It

functions as an empathy and messaging engine — translating deep psychological patterns

into relatable, human language that emotionally connects with the audience.

It maps out ten core emotional dynamics (e.g. Safety vs. Control, Shame & Self-Worth,

Emotional Eating, Overachieving, All-or-Nothing Thinking) and breaks each into three levels:

1. Psychological Core — the root emotional driver behind a client's behavior (e.g. fear,

shame, lack of safety).

2. Translation Layer — how that emotion appears in real life (thoughts, habits, internal

dialogue).

3. Human Language Hook — how to speak to it directly in captions, videos, or ads so

the audience instantly feels understood.

For social media content, this ensures that GPT doesn't just "sound motivational," but

speaks to the subconscious truth of the viewer — the inner conflicts that drive behavior

(e.g., "You don't lack discipline, you lack self-trust").

For the developer: this file teaches the GPT how to connect Simon's brand voice to

human emotion and client psychology. It allows the AI to select phrasing, tone, and story

angles that make the audience feel recognized and safe, increasing authenticity, empathy,

and conversion potential.

Number 4

This document provides the behavioral and situational intelligence layer for the custom

GPT — essentially, a library of 100 real-world problems and patterns the target audience

experiences. It helps the AI recognize, categorize, and respond to human behavior as it

appears in everyday life, instead of speaking in theory or general advice.

Each problem reflects what Simon's coaching audience does, says, or feels — observable

habits like "promising to relax but cleaning instead" or "eating perfectly all week, then

bingeing on Saturday." These examples represent the symptoms of deeper emotional or

structural issues identified in the previous "Avatar Keywords Matrix" (e.g., shame, control,

fear, perfectionism).

The 100 problems are divided into:

● Emotional & Relatable (1–50): Everyday self-sabotaging loops and emotional

struggles (e.g. guilt, comparison, overcontrol).

● Educational & System-Focused (51–100): Practical structure or planning failures

(e.g. no backup plan while traveling, unrealistic routines, no rest systems).

Each entry is tagged with:

● The avatar type (e.g. Misaligned Achiever, Self-Fixer, Overwhelmed Caregiver)

● The core emotion driving the problem (e.g. guilt, shame, overwhelm)

● The Fit For Life coaching angle (RESET, REWIRE, REBUILD), which determines

how to address it.

For the developer: this file teaches the GPT how to ground its responses and content ideas

in real, observable human behavior. It allows the system to generate posts, scripts, or advice

that sound specific, emotionally accurate, and directly relevant to the audience's lived

experiences — bridging the psychological insights (from the previous document) with

practical storytelling and coaching outputs.

Number 5

This document is the core audience and brand identity map — the single most important

reference for how the custom GPT should understand, think, and speak to the Fit For Life

Coaching™ client. It defines who the audience is, what they feel, believe, struggle with,

and desire, so the AI can create content that sounds human, empathetic, and precisely

targeted.

It outlines both external and internal worlds of the audience:

● Who they are: Busy, emotionally intelligent adults (mostly 28–45, often women)

who've succeeded in career and life but lost structure and peace with their body.

They're not lazy — they're exhausted from perfectionism and "all-or-nothing" loops.

● Outer world (real life): Daily chaos, time pressure, family stress, emotional eating,

and failed restarts.

● Inner world (self-talk): Guilt, shame, fear, frustration, and hopelessness — the

emotional core behind surface-level habits.

● Myths & wrong beliefs: Fitness misconceptions (e.g., "carbs make you fat," "I must

train daily") that fuel guilt and restriction.

● Desires & buying motivation: They don't want a perfect body — they want peace,

balance, self-trust, and freedom from guilt.

● Triggers & objections: Fear of failure, burnout from past programs, and emotional

vulnerability ("I've tried everything").

It also defines the brand differentiation and tone:

● You are not a hype coach — you are the calm, structured, psychologically aware

guide who's lived the chaos and rebuilt it.

● The voice should always feel grounded, kind, intelligent, and real.

● Core brand phrases include: "Structure beats willpower," "Stop starting over,"

"Freedom, not fear," "Habits over hacks."

For the developer: this document is the avatar engine of the system.

It tells the GPT exactly who it's talking to, what emotional language to use, and what kind of

transformation it represents. All other modules (content strategy, emotional hooks, scripting)

must align with this psychological and emotional map. This ensures every GPT output

sounds like it comes directly from the Fit For Life brand — emotionally attuned, human, and

trustworthy.

Number 6

This document is the master blueprint of the Fit For Life Coaching™ brand. It defines the

system's complete identity — the philosophy, audience, positioning, tone, messaging rules,

and content logic that every GPT output must follow. In essence, this file provides the

operating system for all brand communication and decision-making inside the custom

GPT.

Key functions for the model:

1. Brand Core & Mission

○ Promise: Help busy adults rebuild body, habits, and confidence — without

restriction.

○ Philosophy: You don't need more control — you need better systems.

○ Mission: Replace chaos, guilt, and restarts with structure, peace, and

self-trust.

The GPT should treat this as the north star filter — every answer, caption,

or script must align with this message.

2. Category & Differentiation

○ Defines the niche: Mind–Body Systems Coaching™, bridging fitness and

psychology.

○ Emphasizes sustainability and emotional intelligence instead of quick fixes or

hype.

○ Differentiation: calm authority, human depth, system-thinking over motivation.

This allows the GPT to position the brand uniquely among fitness coaches.

3. Audience Framework

○ Target: 27–45-year-old professionals (mostly women), emotionally intelligent,

overwhelmed by inconsistency, guilt, and perfectionism.

○ Includes three core avatars (Misaligned Achiever, Overwhelmed Caregiver,

Self-Fixer) with distinct pain points and emotional triggers.

This ensures the GPT adjusts tone and messaging per audience type.

4. Transformation System

○ Based on the Fit For Life Method™:

1. RESET (Body & Environment)

2. REWIRE (Mind & Emotions)

3. REBUILD (Structure & Identity)

○ Supported by the 6 Layers of Change Framework (Awareness → Vision).

This logic must guide how the GPT structures educational or motivational

content — every idea maps back to these pillars.

5. Tone, Language & Messaging Rules

○ Voice: Grounded, intelligent, emotionally honest, calm authority.

○ Avoid: "grind," "hustle," or toxic discipline narratives.

○ Always reduce shame, simplify complexity, and validate the audience's effort.

○ Core phrases: "Systems > Willpower," "Stop starting over," "Build structure,

not stress."

These tone rules must be hard-coded into the model's communication logic.

6. Content Strategy (Dual Layer Formula)

○ Every post has:

1. Practical Hook (nutrition, habits, or structure).

2. Emotional Layer (guilt, mindset, identity).

○ The model should always blend tactical value with emotional insight.

7. Alignment Checklist & Quality Control

○ Provides a 7-point "on-brand" test to ensure every GPT output reflects the

right philosophy, tone, and coaching perspective.

In short: this document defines the complete identity and strategic backbone of the

custom GPT.

It ensures the system doesn't just "create fitness content," but thinks, speaks, and teaches

exactly like the Fit For Life Coaching™ brand — grounded, emotionally intelligent, and

system-driven.

Number 7

This document provides the complete content architecture and execution map for Fit For

Life Coaching™ — essentially, the production system your custom GPT must follow when

planning, prioritizing, or generating social media content across Instagram, YouTube Shorts,

and TikTok.

It defines how content moves through the three funnel stages (TOFU → MOFU → BOFU),

ensuring that every idea or script fits a clear strategic purpose — from grabbing attention to

building trust and driving conversions.

Here's how it connects to the AI's logic:

1. Funnel Awareness & Functionality

○ TOFU (Top of Funnel) → Awareness & Discovery: short, emotionally

relatable videos that make people feel "that's me."

○ MOFU (Middle of Funnel) → Connection & Value: structured content that

shows understanding, teaches simple systems, and proves credibility.

○ BOFU (Bottom of Funnel) → Trust & Conversion: transformation stories,

proof, and lifestyle reflection content that convert followers into clients.

The GPT should understand this as the audience journey and automatically

classify content ideas or scripts under the correct funnel level.

2. Six Content Pillars (core topics for the AI to work within):

○ Pillar 1: Real-Life Struggles → relatable loops & chaos moments.

○ Pillar 2: Myth-Busting & Simplification → calm education & clarity.

○ Pillar 3: Systems, Structure & Real-Life Solutions → practical, real-life

coaching value.

○ Pillar 4: Psychology of Change & Identity → emotional mindset

transformation.

○ Pillar 5: Transformation Stories & Proof → human stories, client results,

authenticity.

○ Pillar 6: Lifestyle, Balance & Personal Growth → long-term health and

emotional freedom.

3. Implementation System (90-Day Cycle)

○ Outlines a weekly rhythm (5–6 posts) balancing awareness, value, and trust

content.

○ Provides format guidelines (split skits, direct monologues, cinematic talks,

B-roll + voice-over, etc.).

○ Includes a 4-week rotation pattern to maintain engagement variety (story

series, Q&As, recipes, client stories).

The GPT should use this to generate content calendars, scripts, and

weekly plans that follow this strategic mix.

4. Tone & Format Logic

○ Emphasis on authentic storytelling, calm authority, emotional connection,

and real-life relatability.

○ Avoid hype or perfection; focus on emotional truth, structure, and

psychological insight.

○ Always end with subtle, value-based CTAs (e.g., "Save this," "DM RESET,"

"Follow for calm, real-life fitness").

For the developer: this file gives the GPT its operational structure — how to decide what

kind of content to produce, when, and for which audience stage. It's the master execution

map linking emotional storytelling (Docs 1–4), brand identity (Docs 5–6), and strategic funnel

marketing into one coherent, automated content system.

Number 8

This document functions as the attention and retention engine for the custom GPT —

teaching it how to keep viewers watching, feeling, and engaging with short-form video

content (Reels, TikToks, Shorts). While earlier documents define what to say, this one

defines how to say it — the micro-dynamics that make content psychologically sticky and

emotionally addictive.

It's based on the science of attention, dopamine cycles, and emotional pacing in social

media. It explains why people stop scrolling, what keeps them hooked, and how storytelling

structure and editing rhythm affect retention rates — the key metric for reach and growth on

Instagram and TikTok.

The GPT should internalize this as the "delivery behavior" layer of all short-form content

creation.

Key functions for the system:

1. Retention Psychology & Viewer Behavior

○ Breaks down the first 1–3 seconds as the critical retention window.

○ Explains how to build emotional momentum — using curiosity, pattern breaks,

and tension-release cycles.

○ Defines attention "reset points" every 5–8 seconds through visual, tonal, or

narrative shifts.

○ Clarifies how viewers subconsciously seek either relatability, relief, or

revelation.

2. Hook Engineering

○ Outlines 12+ types of scroll-stopping hooks: emotional (e.g. guilt/conflict),

visual (motion/action), or cognitive (unexpected truth).

○ Teaches the GPT to match hook type → content purpose → audience pain

point, rather than using generic phrasing.

○ Includes hook formulas like "You don't fail because of X — you fail because of

Y" or "This one habit is silently ruining your progress."

3. Script Pacing & Rhythm Rules

○ Introduces the 3-Phase Retention Flow: Emotional Hook → Tension/Curiosity

→ Emotional Payoff/Relief.

○ Describes how to balance emotional storytelling with micro "pattern breaks"

(camera angles, pauses, music, cuts, or phrasing).

○ GPT should apply these pacing cues automatically when drafting short scripts

or suggesting editing guidelines.

4. Voice & Delivery Psychology

○ Encourages authenticity, imperfection, and emotion over polish — key to

algorithmic trust and watch time.

○ Defines tonal shifts (curious → calm → reflective) that sustain viewer

connection.

○ Emphasizes the importance of vocal pacing, pauses, and contrasts ("silent

beats" to let emotion land).

5. Performance Optimization Metrics

○ Outlines how audience retention, replays, saves, and comments are affected

by emotional hooks and story payoff.

○ The GPT should use these principles to generate algorithm-aware yet

emotionally intelligent scripts.

For the developer: this file gives the GPT its engagement intelligence layer — the

psychological and structural rules behind viral retention. It allows the system to automatically

shape every piece of content not just for clarity or emotion, but for viewer behavior and

algorithmic performance — ensuring the brand's videos don't just sound good but perform

exceptionally well on Instagram and TikTok.

Number 10

This document defines the data and performance measurement framework for the

custom GPT — essentially, the analytics lens through which all Instagram content success is

evaluated. It ensures the model not only creates content but also understands how success

is measured and optimized in a social media context.

It provides the essential Instagram key metrics that drive organic growth, algorithmic reach,

and conversion performance — allowing the GPT to interpret and act on engagement

signals intelligently.

Core areas to embed in the system logic:

1. Primary Growth Metrics:

○ Reach: How many unique accounts see the content — driven by hooks,

watch time, and saves.

○ Plays / Views: Total video starts, directly linked to audience interest and

visual cues.

○ Watch Time & Retention Rate: The most important factor for algorithmic

ranking. The GPT should use retention principles (from "The Retention

Blueprint") to improve these metrics.

2. Engagement & Interaction Metrics:

○ Likes, Comments, Saves, Shares: Indicate emotional resonance and value

perception.

○ Save-to-Like Ratio: A key proxy for educational or valuable content that

builds trust.

○ Comments per Reach: Helps evaluate how conversational and emotionally

triggering a post is.

3. Conversion & Funnel Metrics:

○ Profile Visits, Follows, and Link Clicks: Signal movement from awareness

to conversion (important for BOFU content).

○ Story and Reel Interactions: Indicate relational engagement strength with

followers.

4. Strategic Application for GPT:

○ The model should be able to connect content performance → content type

→ optimization suggestions.

○ For example, if watch time is low, it should recommend stronger hooks or

faster pacing; if saves are high but reach is low, it should suggest repurposing

that content into new hooks.

○ GPT's goal is to act as a strategic content analyst, not just a writer —

interpreting metrics and adjusting strategy accordingly.

For the developer: this document gives the GPT its performance analytics layer —

enabling data-informed decision-making. It allows the system to analyze engagement

patterns, learn what resonates with the audience, and dynamically adjust content strategies

to continuously improve retention, reach, and conversions.

Number 11

This document defines the hook intelligence layer of the custom GPT — the part of the

system responsible for capturing attention and emotional resonance in the first 1–3 seconds

of any video, post, or caption. On social media, this opening moment determines whether

people stop scrolling or keep scrolling. The hooks outlined here are not just headlines —

they are psychological access points designed to make the audience feel seen, curious,

and emotionally connected within seconds.

The document contains a full Hook Framework System that teaches the GPT how to

identify, select, and craft the most effective hook for every piece of content — based on the

script, context, and purpose.

1. The Role of Hooks

Hooks are the entry point to attention and emotion.

They define whether the audience invests energy in the message that follows. This is critical

because the first few seconds of a Reel or TikTok determine retention — and therefore

reach, engagement, and conversion.

Each hook type triggers a different psychological response. The GPT must understand how

to match the right type to the right moment, depending on the content purpose, audience

state, and emotional goal.

2. Types of Hooks & Their Purpose

The document includes 100+ hook formulas, grouped by psychological driver and

strategic intent:

● Curiosity Hooks — create open loops ("You don't fail because of X — you fail

because of Y")

→ Purpose: make people curious enough to keep watching.

● Emotional Hooks — speak to inner pain, shame, or self-recognition ("You're not lazy

— you're just tired of being perfect.")

→ Purpose: build instant empathy and connection.

● Reframe Hooks — flip a common belief or misconception ("Carbs don't make you fat

— chaos does.")

→ Purpose: position the brand as calm authority and thought leader.

● Pattern-Break Hooks — use contrast, tension, or unexpected statements ("The

fitness industry doesn't want you to know this…")

→ Purpose: interrupt autopilot scrolling and create focus.

● Story & Identity Hooks — use personal or client transformation moments ("I used to

wake up every Monday promising to start again…")

→ Purpose: humanize the message and lead with vulnerability.

Every piece of content should open with one of these hook archetypes, adapted to tone and

context.

3. Analytical Function of the GPT

The GPT must analyze the script or idea first, then decide which hook type is most

effective — based on:

● The core pain point or emotion in the script (from the Avatar Matrix).

● The story or context (e.g., Simon's own story, client example, or systemic lesson).

● The content pillar and funnel stage (from the Content Pillar Strategy).

● The desired emotional effect (relief, curiosity, hope, insight).

● Quantitative optimization (hooks that historically drive retention and watch time).

The system should automatically assess these layers to generate the most relevant,

emotionally precise hook — not random templates.

4. Integration with the Full GPT System

This hook framework interacts with all other modules:

● The Retention Blueprint → ensures hooks align with pacing and editing rhythm.

● Avatar Keyword Matrix → ensures emotional accuracy and language empathy.

● Content Pillar Strategy → ensures hooks match content type and funnel purpose.

● Brand Northstar → ensures tone, authenticity, and brand consistency.

The GPT must merge all of these data points when creating or evaluating hooks — making

sure every hook is not only attention-grabbing but also brand-aligned, emotionally

intelligent, and conversion-driven.

5. Strategic Purpose

For the developer:

This document gives the GPT its front-end engagement engine — the system that

decides how to begin every piece of communication. It must be capable of:

● Recognizing which hook style fits best per video or post.

● Generating multiple alternative hooks for A/B testing.

● Ranking hooks by predicted engagement potential (based on psychological match

and narrative fit).

The result: a GPT that doesn't just write text — it strategically engineers attention,

retention, and emotional connection, ensuring every message performs effectively within

the social media environment.

Would you like me to format this version into a structured "developer briefing" layout (like an

internal documentation page — with headers, bold subpoints, and logic flow)? It would make

it even easier for your tech team to integrate.

Number 12

This document provides the technical and visual engagement guidelines that the custom

GPT must understand when generating content recommendations, editing instructions, or

script pacing notes. It defines the micro-editing behavior behind high-retention short-form

content, ensuring that every video the GPT outlines or refines is both visually dynamic and

psychologically optimized for attention.

It focuses on the "3-Second Rule" — a foundational video principle stating that something

on screen must change every 3 seconds to maintain viewer engagement. This principle is

essential for Instagram Reels, TikToks, and YouTube Shorts, where users decide within

seconds whether to keep watching.

The GPT must integrate this as part of its retention and execution logic, meaning that

when it creates video scripts or content ideas, it should include:

● Visual pacing instructions: e.g., "cut to B-roll," "insert text overlay," "switch to

close-up."

● Editing variety: alternate between different camera angles, zooms, or transitions to

create motion and rhythm.

● On-screen emphasis: highlight keywords with text overlays or motion graphics to

reinforce message clarity.

● Sensory engagement: use subtle sound effects or color grading changes to mark

emotional or narrative transitions.

This document complements The Retention Blueprint by adding a technical-visual

execution layer — translating storytelling and psychological engagement principles into

practical editing rules.

For the developer: this file provides the GPT's visual retention logic — ensuring that

generated scripts and content outlines automatically include pacing, motion, and editing

cues that match social media attention standards. It connects directly to the system's

retention intelligence, guaranteeing that every video idea is not only emotionally resonant but

also visually engineered for high engagement and watch time.

Number 13

This document defines the carousel post intelligence layer for the custom GPT — the

system responsible for creating static, scrollable posts on Instagram and LinkedIn

that mimic the engagement psychology of short-form videos, but through visuals and

text.

Carousels are not videos — they are slide-based storytelling assets, typically 8–10

frames long, where each slide builds curiosity, tension, and emotional engagement.

Their goal is to make the user swipe until the end, boosting algorithmic reach and

audience retention.

The GPT must treat this as a distinct content format that follows its own rhythm and

cognitive flow, different from video pacing.

1. Purpose & Role

Carousels are designed to:

● Stop the scroll with a strong visual or text-based hook on Slide 1.

● Build curiosity and micro-tension across the following slides.

● Deliver insight, value, or emotional payoff near the end.

● End with a call-to-action (CTA) — such as saving, sharing, following, or

reflecting.

The GPT must understand that a carousel's job is to simplify and visualize complex

ideas (like mindset shifts, fat loss frameworks, or self-awareness concepts) while

keeping viewers emotionally engaged.

2. Structure & Cognitive Flow

The document provides a blueprint similar to video storytelling, but optimized for

reading and swiping behavior:

● Slide 1 – Hook: Emotional or cognitive pattern break. Must trigger curiosity.

● Slides 2–4 – Problem/Recognition: Mirror the audience's inner dialogue or

emotional loop.

● Slides 5–7 – Insight/Solution: Reframe perspective or reveal a system insight.

● Slide 8–9 – Resolution: Provide emotional relief or practical clarity.

● Slide 10 – CTA: Encourage engagement ("Save this for later," "Follow for more

calm structure," etc.).

The GPT should generate or evaluate carousels using this sequence to ensure

narrative and retention consistency.

3. Visual & Writing Logic

The GPT must apply the "visual pacing" concept (from the social media rules

document) to carousels in a non-video context — meaning:

● Each slide needs a visual or textual change that re-grabs attention (contrast in

color, layout, or phrasing).

● Text must be short, bold, and scan-friendly (max 2–3 lines per slide).

● Visual hierarchy: one big message per slide, with whitespace for clarity.

● Maintain emotional pacing through alternating contrast (pain → insight →

relief).

4. Integration with Other Modules

● Hooks Master Document → used for crafting Slide 1 headlines.

● Retention Blueprint → guides emotional pacing (tension → curiosity → relief).

● Avatar Matrix → ensures language and examples align with the audience's

emotions and beliefs.

● Brand Northstar → ensures tone consistency (calm, grounded, intelligent).

The GPT must combine these systems to generate carousel frameworks that are

emotionally intelligent, visually effective, and brand-consistent.

5. For the Developer

This file gives the GPT its static content design logic — teaching it how to think in

slides rather than seconds. The model should be able to:

● Generate complete 8–10 slide carousel outlines (with hooks, flow, and CTA).

● Evaluate existing carousel copy for retention and emotional pacing.

● Recommend improvements in structure, visuals, and message clarity.

It ensures the GPT doesn't just create videos — it also masters the high-performing

written-visual storytelling format that drives growth, saves, and shares on Instagram.
